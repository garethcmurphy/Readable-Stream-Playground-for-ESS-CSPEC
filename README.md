# Readable Stream Playground for ESS Neutron Data 🚀💾  

This repository is a sandbox for experimenting with **Readable Streams** in JavaScript. It focuses on processing **CSPEC sample data** from the **ESS Neutron Data Source**, specifically for use in the **DMSC (Data Management and Software Center)** at the **European Spallation Source (ESS)**. The sandbox includes functionality to stream data and write it to a database.

---

## Features ✨  

- **Readable Stream Testing**: Experiment with JavaScript streams for handling neutron data.  
- **CSPEC Sample Data Integration**: Stream and process sample data from the ESS CSPEC instrument.  
- **Database Writing**: Store processed data in a database for further analysis.  

---

## Prerequisites 🛠️  

- **Node.js** (14+ recommended).  
- A running database instance (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL).  

---

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/readable-stream-cspec.git  
cd readable-stream-cspec  

2. Install dependencies:  
npm install  

3. Configure database settings in `config.js`.  

---

## Usage 🔧  

1. **Run the Stream Processor**:  
   Start the script to process CSPEC data:  
   node stream_processor.js  

2. **Simulate CSPEC Data**:  
   Use `data_simulator.js` to generate sample CSPEC neutron data for testing:  
   node data_simulator.js  

3. **Write to Database**:  
   Ensure database settings are correctly configured in `config.js`. Processed data will be automatically stored in the database.

## File Structure 📂  

- `stream_processor.js`: Main script for processing CSPEC data using readable streams.  
- `data_simulator.js`: Simulates CSPEC sample data for testing.  
- `config.js`: Configuration file for database connections.  
- `README.md`: Documentation for the repository.  

---

## Example Commands  

- Process CSPEC Data:  
  node stream_processor.js  

- Simulate Sample Data:  
  node data_simulator.js  

---

## Customization 🔧  

1. **Modify Data Simulation**: Update `data_simulator.js` to generate data that matches your specific requirements.  
2. **Change Database**: Edit `config.js` to switch between MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or other databases.
